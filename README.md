# Predicting Student Performance

This project and research report addresses the question, "What factor is the most important for students' academic performance," by utilizing machine learning techniques like Regression and Classification models. From our results, we found that five features that most impact students' academic performance: number of failures the student has in the past, internet access, absences, education level of parents, and total alcohol consumption. Students, as well as academic institutions that are looking to provide assistance, can focus on improving the five areas.
